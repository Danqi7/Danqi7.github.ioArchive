I am **Danqi Liao (廖丹琪)**, an undergrad student studying Computer Science at Northwestern University. I enjoy building stuff and learning about tech/startup news. Find more about me at [my personal website](http://danqiliao.com).

Motivation for starting my blog: More often than not, I found myself disappointed with current news outlets: they tend to report more on sensational/negative news, and publish news with even more sensational titles/headlines. Tired of same old sensational news, I start to search meaningful news and interesting blogs/articles by myself. More importantly I want to share with people the pieces that are worthy reading.

我是**廖丹琪**, 目前是美国西北大学本科生，主修计算机科学。我喜欢自己动手写东西，我也喜欢了解科技和初创公司。（[我的个人网站](http://danqiliao.com)).

开这个博客的动力：对主流媒体和流行新闻感到失望，因为主流媒体和流行新闻更倾向于报道有争议的，负面性的新闻。标题党太多。在有意思的新闻／文章越来越少的情况下，我开始自己寻找有意思的文章和新闻。我一向秉承的想法就是，独乐乐不如众乐乐，所以希望能把有意思有趣的新闻／文章分享给大家。
